# Display Bookshelves

This repository contains a script that displays bookshelves based on certain criteria from a specified website. The script retrieves information such as the name and price of bookshelves and performs various filtering operations.

## Problem Statement

The goal is to display bookshelves based on the following criteria:

1. The bookshelves should be priced below Rs. 15,000.
2. Out-of-stock items should also be included.
3. The storage type of the bookshelves should be open.

<!--In addition, the script should retrieve the details of the first three study chairs with the highest recommendation, considering ties.
-->
## Solution

To solve the problem, the script performs the following steps:

1. Retrieves and displays the name and price of the first three bookshelves that meet the criteria of being below Rs. 15,000, having an open storage type, and including out-of-stock items.
2. Retrieves and displays all sub-menu items under the "Being-At-home" category from the collections section of a specified website.
3. Simulates the process of customizing a birthday/anniversary gift card on the website. It fills the necessary details, deliberately providing an invalid input (e.g., an invalid email address) to capture and display the resulting error message.

## Key Automation Scope

The script covers the following key automation tasks:

- Handling alerts that may appear during the execution.
- Performing drag and drop operations, if required.
- Implementing search functionality, if applicable.
- Extracting menu items and storing them in collections for further use.
- Navigating back to the home page after completing a specific task.
- Scrolling down a web page to access additional content.
- Filling out various forms on different web page objects.
- Capturing and displaying warning messages, if any.

1. Install the necessary dependencies for the script to run successfully.
2. Run the script on a compatible web browser.
3. Observe the output, which will display the bookshelves, sub-menu items, and any error or warning messages encountered during execution.
